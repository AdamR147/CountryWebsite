        <h3>Cultural Dance</h3>
        <p>Dominican cultural dances are a vibrant expression of the island's rich blend of African, Spanish, and Indigenous Taino influences. The most iconic dance is Merengue, known for its lively two-step rhythm and playful hip movements, often performed to the sound of the guira and tambora. Bachata, with its slower, more romantic style, reflects themes of love and heartbreak and has became a global favorite. In rural areas, traditional like palos and gaga highlight deep Afro-Dominican spiritual roots, featuring drums, call-and-response singing, and colorful themes. Together, these dances celebrate community, history, and the joyful spirit of Dominican culture.  </p>
